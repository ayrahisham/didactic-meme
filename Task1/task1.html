						<p><i>True to its name, the bridge mimics the undulating shape of a wave,
						curving and twisting along its entire 274-metre length. Its form is 
						anchored by steel arches and filled in with curved ‘ribs’—slats of 
						Balau wood, a dense hardwood used in heavy construction and which 
						is found only in Southeast Asia.</i></p>
